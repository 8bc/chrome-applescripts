# Chrome AppleScripts

* Break current tab into new window
* Copy URLs of current window to clipboard
* Duplicate current tab
* Duplicate current tab as incognito window
* Duplicate current window as incognito window
* Reload all tabs in current window

Recommended usage:

Clone or download into `~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Google Chrome` and optionally set up keyboard shortcuts with [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) or just use the menu item for scripts you don't use often.

One-liner (only if you don't have anything in `~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Google Chrome` yet):

    git clone https://github.com/Cottser/chrome-applescripts.git "$HOME/Library/Scripts/Applications/Google Chrome"
